# FDI_animation

This directory consists of Nepal shp. files and R code. The R code generates Nepal map by district. 
The final output from the is to find the pattern of FDI flow in Nepal, in different districts from India and China. 
Industrial Animation.R is the main file. The other R files need not be executed manually, as the code in the main file will automatically call it. It is important to unzip the Nepal Map.zip. 
The code calls many library functions. You may need to install such packages if not already. 
If the animation fails to work properly, try calling install.packages("GIFSKI")
